Networking basics (ip route, ip a, etc.)
Host discovery (nmap -sn, netdiscover, fping)
Port scanning variations (TCP/UDP, top ports, full range)
Passive recon commands (whois, theHarvester, sublist3r, wafw00f)
Google dorks section
DNS enum commands (dig, dnsenum, fierce)
General methodology on order of scans
