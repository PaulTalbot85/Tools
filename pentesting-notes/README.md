## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Prepare** – Before the engagement, review the relevant section(s) for your target scope.
2. **Execute** – Copy/paste commands into your terminal during testing, modifying as needed.
3. **Document** – Use the `note_taking.md` templates to record findings as you go.
4. **Deliver** – Build your final report using the `report_template.md` in `06-Reporting/`.
