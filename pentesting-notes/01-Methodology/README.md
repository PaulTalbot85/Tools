# Methodology
1) Scope/Setup → hosts, /etc/hosts, VPN, baseline scans  
2) Recon/Enum → HTTP, SMB/LDAP, SNMP, banners  
3) Initial Access → creds, defaults, public vulns  
4) Privesc → local enum, weak perms, kernel/service vulns  
5) Lateral/Pivot → socks/proxychains, tunnels, port forwards  
6) Proof/Report → screenshots, commands, remediations
