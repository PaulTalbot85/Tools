# 02 ‚Äì Network

This section covers enumeration, exploitation, and pivoting techniques for common network services.  
Each file focuses on **one specific protocol or post-exploitation technique** so you can quickly open only what you need.

## üõ† Usage

1. **Initial Enumeration** ‚Äì Use `snmp.md`, `smb.md`, `ftp.md`, `ssh.md`, `mssql.md`, `mysql.md`, and `smtp.md` for direct service checks.
2. **Internal Movement** ‚Äì Once inside, use `winrm.md`, `pivoting.md`, and `tunnelling.md` to access deeper network segments.
3. **Targeted Access** ‚Äì Open the file for the exact service you‚Äôre facing and copy/paste commands into your terminal.
4. **Maintain Scope Awareness** ‚Äì Brute force only when allowed by scope and after exhausting enumeration.

## üîç Quick Start Commands

| Protocol  | Fast Check Example |
|-----------|--------------------|
| SNMP      | `snmpwalk -v2c -c public <TARGET>` |
| SMB       | `smbclient -L //<TARGET> -N` |
| FTP       | `ftp <TARGET>` (try `anonymous`) |
| SSH       | `ssh <USER>@<TARGET>` |
| MSSQL     | `mssqlclient.py 'sa:<PW>@<TARGET>'` |
| MySQL     | `mysql -h <TARGET> -u root -p` |
| SMTP      | `nc <TARGET> 25` |
| WinRM     | `evil-winrm -i <TARGET> -u <USER> -p <PW>` |

> **Tip:** For speed during live testing, keep your most-used `.md` files open in a second terminal or split-pane editor so you can copy/paste instantly.
