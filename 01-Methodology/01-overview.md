## Core Phases
1. **Pre-Engagement**
   - Scoping
   - Legal authorisation
   - Rules of engagement
2. **Information Gathering**
   - Passive Recon
   - Active Recon
3. **Enumeration**
   - Host discovery
   - Port scanning
   - Service enumeration
4. **Vulnerability Analysis**
5. **Exploitation**
6. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Privilege escalation
   - Persistence (if in scope)
   - Data gathering
7. **Lateral Movement**
8. **Reporting & Debrief**

## Key Professional Considerations
- Always obtain **written permission** before testing.
- Maintain **secure logs** of all actions and timestamps.
- Use **impact minimisation** techniques to avoid service disruption.
