## Methodology Flow
1. **Scoping & Rules of Engagement**
2. **Information Gathering**
   - Passive Recon
   - Active Recon
3. **Enumeration**
   - Host Discovery
   - Port Scanning
   - Service Enumeration
4. **Vulnerability Research**
5. **Initial Access**
6. **Privilege Escalation**
7. **Post-Exploitation**
8. **Pivoting & Lateral Movement**
9. **Reporting**

## Exam Speed Tips
- Always start with **top ports quick scan**, then **full TCP** in parallel.
- Enumerate while scans run (e.g., web, SMB, DNS).
- Work from **low-hanging fruit** outward.
- Document commands as you go.
