# 03 ‚Äì Web

This section contains enumeration, vulnerability testing, and exploitation techniques for web applications and HTTP-based services.  
Each file is focused on one area or attack type so you can quickly jump to the exact technique you need.

## üõ† Usage

1. **Start with `http_enum.md`** to fingerprint technologies, gather headers, and map the application.
2. **Run `dir_enum.md`** to discover hidden endpoints and backup files.
3. **Test for vulnerabilities** using the relevant attack files (`sqli.md`, `xss.md`, etc.).
4. **Leverage CMS-specific files** (`wordpress.md`, `drupal.md`, `rejetto_hfs.md`, `spip.md`) for targeted exploitation.
5. **Document everything** for reporting and pivoting.

> **Tip:** Always save tool output to files (`-oN`, `-oA`, or `tee`) so you can quickly reference it later in the engagement.
