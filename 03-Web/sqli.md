# SQL Injection (Authorized targets only)

## High-level flow
1) Identify parameters (GET/POST/JSON)
2) Error-based clues in responses
3) Boolean/time-based inference (safe tests)
4) Confirm only within authorization; log evidence

## Notes
- Automated exploitation commands intentionally omitted. Use your approved internal playbook where permitted.
